MVC:

View:
    - anything have to do with user interface
    - no logic on manipulation of data involved
        - view doesn't know what it is displaying
          
    DisplayWindow()
        model = Model()
    ModifyWindow()

Logic:
Model()
    def access()        # accesses data from the context using the read method of repository
    def modify()        # modifies data of context using the update method of repository

Controller()
    - this is the brain of the application

Data:
    Context()
        def load()      # loads data from the file (similar to a pull request)
        def save()      # saves data to the file (similar to push request)
    
    Repository()
        - acts as an intermediary between the model and context

        def create()    # creates different repository based on type of product etc
        def read()      # to read the content of the context to the model
        def update()    # to update the data sent by the model to context
        def delete()    # to delete a repository
